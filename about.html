                I was born and raised in northeast Ohio, which explains why I am a fan of the Cavaliers and the Indians; much of my family is from Pittsburgh which explains why I love the Steelers.
                My brother and his girlfriend still live in that area, but my parents have moved to the warmth of Florida.
                In this picture we are enjoying some good times with champagne on a family vacation.

                In 2003 I moved to Chicago for my undergraduate time at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
                I absolutely love Chicago and the great friends and professors that I met during my time in the applied mathematics department.

                During my undergraduate time, I was also fortunate enough to participate in a summer research project in Hong Kong, which sparked in my a permanent love of the city and the wonderful people living there.
                This picture was taken during that summer (back when I still had dark hair) and includes amazing people such as Ray Chan, Michael Ng, Graeme Fairweather and Gene Golub.

                I did grad school at Cornell University in applied math in 2007 under under Charlie Van Loan; Dr. Van Loan taught me a lot, though I did not always understand it at the time. As part of my Ph. D. research, I worked at Argonne National Labs with Lois Curfman McInnes and Hong Zhang.

                After graduate school, I spent some postdoc time split between the University of Colorado and 北京国际学院.  This was a wonderful opportunity during which I wrote a <a href="https://worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9335">book on kernel methods</a> with the incomparable Greg Fasshauer.

                Midway through 2015, I decided to become an AI expert (by calling myself an AI expert) and joined a San Francisco-based company called SigOpt.  I spend 6 wonderful years with that company, growing from just 4 of us to 24 prior to an acquisition by Intel in 2020.
              </p>
              <p>
                My time at SigOpt was an extraordinary time, including a lot of learning and a lot of great relationships.  I have more pictures than I can count of my time there, but I want to emphasize in this picture that we were also sponsoring conferences.  And I thought that was awesome.

                During COVID, I moved to the wonderful city of Honolulu, where I was able to work remotely for Intel on research projects and leading SigOpt within Intel.  I cannot thank the community in Honolulu enough for welcoming me and providing me a calm perspective during a stressful time in my life.
              </p>
              <p>
                This picture is a perfect encapsulation of my time with SigOpt.  A solid group of former SigOpt team members came out to Honolulu during ICML in 2022 to celebrate the good times.

                After leaving Intel, I was a co-founder and CTO at Distributional from 2023 to 2025, trying to figure out how to analyze and test GenAI systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of that position, I relocated to Toronto, where there was a hub of DBNL employees.  This picture was our wonderful DBNL Toronto crew together at a Raptors game.
