        <h5>Growing Up</h5>
        <p> I was born and raised in northeast Ohio, which explains why I am a fan of the Cavaliers and
            the Indians; much of my family is from Pittsburgh which explains why I love the Steelers (I
            consider myself a fair-weather Penguins fan).  My parents, Laurel and Jason, and my brother,
            Kevin, still live in the area, though Mom and Dad spend much of the year in Florida (which is
            somewhere that I would much rather visit).
        </p>

        <p> In 2003 I moved to Chicago for my undergraduate time at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
            I absolutely love Chicago and the great friends and professors that I met during that time.
            The applied mathematics department there is a great place to learn and engage with brilliant
            minds, though many of the professors I met have moved on in the past 17 years.  Even so, I
            stay in touch with many and continue to collaborate with as many as I can.
        </p>

        <p> I did grad school at Cornell University in 2007 under
            under <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cv/">Charlie Van Loan</a>>; Dr. Van Loan taught me
            a lot, though I did not always understand it at the time.  While I did very much enjoy learning
            from Dr. Van Loan and the numerous other outstanding professors at Cornell, I did not much enjoy
            living in Cornell --- fortunately, the generous administration at Cornell and Dr. Van Loan
            were flexible and kind enough to let me pursue my Ph. D. research at Argonne National Labs.

        <h5>Moving Around</h5>
        <p> From 2010-2013, I was at Argonne's math and computer science department as a graduate student,
            working with <a href="https://press3.mcs.anl.gov/curfman/">Lois Curfman McInnes</a>
            and <a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~hzhang/">Hong Zhang</a>.
            I worked on computational mathematics tools for running multiphysics simulations;
            my <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/33784/mjm458.pdf?sequence=1">thesis</a> is
            available online, though I think <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1094342012468181">this</a>
            is an infinitely better introduction to the topic.
            I also was fortunate enough to teach some classes at
            IIT, which helped balance out my minimal time physically being (and teaching) at Cornell.  I
            really want to thank everyone at Cornell, Argonne and IIT who supported me in my unorthodox
            path through graduate school.
        </p>

        <p> In fall 2013 I took a postdoc position at University of Colorado-Denver, where I was given time
            to write a book, <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9335">Kernel-based Approximation Methods Using Matlab</a>,
            along with <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/gfasshauer/">Gregory Fasshauer</a> (who I have known since
            my time as an undergrad at IIT).  As part of my time at Denver, the department sent me to Beijing
            to teach at our partner school, 中国农业大学
            <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/internationalprograms/oia/icb/Pages/default.aspx">China Agricultural University</a>.
            That experience was one of the best of my life and I thank both universities for giving me the
            opportunity to study and teach in Beijing.
        </p>

        <p> This is as good a time as any to mention that I have spent numerous chunks of my life in
            Hong Kong, first as an <a href="https://archive.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1044">undergraduate</a>,
            then as a grad student.  I go back as often as possible, most recently in the professional
            context to participate in the Johns Hopkins <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/summer/international/">CTY program</a>
            at HKU.  I think of Hong Kong as my second home and my favorite place in the world; the image below
            recalls one of my fondest memories of my time there.

        <h5>New Adventures</h5>
        <p> I am an academic at heart, but I have been thoroughly enjoying the world of industry since 2015
            when I joined the research team at SigOpt in San Francisco.  SigOpt is a company created to
            "Empower the world's experts" by providing them software and guidance to perform an adaptive
            design of experiments for identifying high performing strategies.  Our customers come from
            a variety of communities, including tech companies, financial companies, government institutions,
            national labs, and universities
            (we have a free <a href="https://sigopt.com/solution/academia/">academic program</a>).
        </p>

        <p> I absolutely love working at SigOpt.  This has been an incredible opportunity for me to explore
            the world of industry while supported by brilliant teammates.  When I arrived, I was not an
            ML expert, and I still would not call myself an ML expert, but I have learned about the
            beautiful interplay between math and statistics and learning theory and practical situations
            which leads to enterprise-grade software.  I cannot thank enough Scott (CEO) and Patrick (CTO)
            for bringing me on board; the next 5 years at SigOpt will be even better than the first 5.
