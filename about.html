        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in northeast Ohio and raised with a deep passion for mathematics and sports. I studied at the Illinois Institute of Technology and later at Cornell University, where I embarked on a journey that led me to research and innovation. My career has evolved from academia to the tech industry, with notable work at institutions such as Argonne National Labs and SigOpt.

        <h3>Growing Up & Moving Around</h3>
        <p>
          My journey spans from my hometown in Ohio, to Chicago, Cornell, Argonne, and beyond. I cherish the time spent in Hong Kong and the personal connections forged along the way.
